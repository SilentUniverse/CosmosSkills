description: Migrate test files from `as` type assertions to @total-typescript/shoehorn. Use when user mentions shoehorn, wants to replace `as` in tests, or needs partial test data.

# Migrate to Shoehorn

> Finding `as` assertions is a structural search, not a text search — use `ast-grep` (`sg`), which matches the TypeScript AST and won't false-match `as` in strings or comments. Falls back to `rg` if `ast-grep` isn't installed (see Workflow step 2).

## Why shoehorn?

`shoehorn` lets you pass partial data in tests while keeping TypeScript happy. It replaces `as` assertions with type-safe alternatives.

**Test code only.** Never use shoehorn in production code.

Problems with `as` in tests:

- Trained not to use it
- Must manually specify target type
- Double-as (`as unknown as Type`) for intentionally wrong data

## Install

```bash
npm i -D @total-typescript/shoehorn   # devDependency — test code only
```

## Migration patterns

### Large objects with few needed properties

Before:

```ts
type Request = {
  body: { id: string };
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  cookies: Record<string, string>;
  // ...20 more properties
};

it("gets user by id", () => {
  // Only care about body.id but must fake entire Request
  getUser({
    body: { id: "123" },
    headers: {},
    cookies: {},
    // ...fake all 20 properties
  });
});
```

After:

```ts
import { fromPartial } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

it("gets user by id", () => {
  getUser(
    fromPartial({
      body: { id: "123" },
    }),
  );
});
```

### `as Type` → `fromPartial()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: "123" } } as Request);
```

After:

```ts
import { fromPartial } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromPartial({ body: { id: "123" } }));
```

### `as unknown as Type` → `fromAny()`

Before:

```ts
getUser({ body: { id: 123 } } as unknown as Request); // wrong type on purpose
```

After:

```ts
import { fromAny } from "@total-typescript/shoehorn";

getUser(fromAny({ body: { id: 123 } }));
```

## When to use each

| Function        | Use case                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromPartial()` | Pass partial data that still type-checks           |
| `fromAny()`     | Pass intentionally wrong data (keeps autocomplete) |
| `fromExact()`   | Force full object (swap with fromPartial later)    |

## Workflow

1. **Gather requirements** - ask user:
   - What test files have `as` assertions causing problems?
   - Are they dealing with large objects where only some properties matter?
   - Do they need to pass intentionally wrong data for error testing?

2. **Install and migrate**:
   - [ ] Install: `npm i -D @total-typescript/shoehorn`
   - [ ] Find `as` assertions in test files (structural, cross-platform):
     - **ast-grep (preferred):** `sg -p '$EXPR as $TYPE' -l ts --globs '*.test.ts' --globs '*.spec.ts'` — same scope as the rg fallback. For double-casts: `sg -p '$EXPR as unknown as $TYPE' -l ts --globs '*.test.ts' --globs '*.spec.ts'`.
     - **Fallback (rg):** `rg ' as [A-Z]' -g '*.test.ts' -g '*.spec.ts'`
   - [ ] Replace `as Type` with `fromPartial()`
   - [ ] Replace `as unknown as Type` with `fromAny()`
   - [ ] Add imports from `@total-typescript/shoehorn`
   - [ ] Run type check **and the affected test files** to verify
