# Writing Skills

## Process

1. **Gather requirements** - ask user about:
   - What task/domain does the skill cover?
   - What specific use cases should it handle?
   - Does it need executable scripts or just instructions?
   - Any reference materials to include?

2. **Draft the skill** - create:
   - SKILL.md with concise instructions
   - Additional reference files if content exceeds 100 lines
   - Utility scripts if deterministic operations needed

3. **Review with user** - present draft and ask:
   - Does this cover your use cases?
   - Anything missing or unclear?
   - Should any section be more/less detailed?

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── <Semantic>.md      # Detailed docs if >100 lines — semantic names (PEDAGOGY.md,
│                      #   not REFERENCE.md); header: "Loaded on demand … when"
└── scripts/           # Utility scripts (if needed)
    └── helper.js
```

## SKILL.md Template

```md
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of capability. Use when [specific triggers]. Keep under 100 words.
argument-hint: "What the argument means"     # optional — for /name <arg> skills
disable-model-invocation: true               # optional — user-typed only, model can't auto-invoke

# Skill Name

## Quick start

[Minimal working example]

## Workflows

[Step-by-step processes with checklists for complex tasks]

## Advanced features

[Link to separate files: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)]
```

## Description Requirements

The description is **the only thing your agent sees** when deciding which skill to load. It's surfaced in the system prompt alongside all other installed skills.

**Goal**: Give your agent just enough info to know:

1. What capability this skill provides
2. When/why to trigger it (specific keywords, contexts, file types)

**Format**:

- Max 1024 chars
- Write in third person
- First sentence: what it does
- Second sentence: "Use when [specific triggers]"

**Good example**:

```
Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Bad example**:

```
Helps with documents.
```

The bad example gives your agent no way to distinguish this from other document skills.

## When to Add Scripts

Add utility scripts when:

- Operation is deterministic (validation, formatting)
- Same code would be generated repeatedly
- Errors need explicit handling

Scripts save tokens and improve reliability vs generated code.

## When to Split Files

Split into separate files when:

- SKILL.md exceeds 100 lines
- Content has distinct domains (finance vs sales schemas)
- Advanced features are rarely needed

## Review Checklist

After drafting, verify:

- [ ] Description includes triggers ("Use when...")
- [ ] SKILL.md under 100 lines
- [ ] No time-sensitive info
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Concrete examples included
- [ ] References one level deep
